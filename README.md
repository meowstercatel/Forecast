# Forecast
A good-looking desktop app to check the current and future weather.
Big thanks to [NRD](https://github.com/nrdsstuff) for letting me use their figma designs.

## How does it work
The website fetches weather information from a 3rd party website and then displays it to the user.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to provide the user a nice-looking weather app.

## User interaction
The user can check the weather and other information like wind speed, UV index, etc. That's pretty much it.

1. Download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer).
